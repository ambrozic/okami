# Signals

Okami includes a signal dispatcher which allows applications to get notified when actions occur somewhere in okami framework. 

Signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place. 

Theyâ€™re especially useful when many pieces of code may be interested in the same events.


## Receiving signals

In code example below, function `response_created` connects to signal `signals.response_created` by being decorated with `signals.receiver`.

Function `response_created` will be called every time signal `signals.response_created` is executed.

```
from okami import signals

@signals.receiver(signals.response_created)
async def response_created(signal, sender, **kwargs):
    print("response_created: {}, {}, {}".format(signal, sender, kwargs))
```


## Configuration

Configuration is a bit awkward because of the way python decorators work.

Make sure your signal receivers are imported at some point in your project otherwise add

`from your.app import signals`

somewhere, i.e. in your top `__init__.py` module.
